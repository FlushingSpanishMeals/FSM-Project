2. Your white paper should explain how you implemented concepts in visual hierarchy, grouping, and similarity in your design

  We made our images speak for themsevels which in turn lead to them playing a big role in our pages. Contrast was heavily used in order to make the content stand out as well as playing with shadow in order to emphasize on content.In terms of grouping we made sure that if we wanted to edit multiple classes we'd target the class that encapsualtes the classes we wanted to edit however for more detailed changes we'd have to target them using .'class name' .'inner class'

3. Your white paper should take another website (that already exists on the web) and analyze it based on the above, creating a wireframe for it as well.

4. Your website should have at least three pages (all hosted locally, that can be accessed from one another). You must create a wireframe for each page

5. You must create a gray paper that explains the HTML, CSS, and JS that you did. It should outline at least 30 different points, showing the code and explaining what it does.

6. Your HTML must include a minimum of one table, links, two lists, five images, a navigation bar, three forms (text box, radio button, checkbox, submit, and button), and anything else you like.

7. Your CSS must be extensive and consistent with your business model and design.

8. You must implement the ideas in at least four out of the first 10 examples in the udemy course.

9. All your group names should appear on the website.

10. You should have one HTML, CSS, and JS file for each page of your website (so altogether there will be nine files). You should upload the files to github and submit a link. On Blackboard, you should be uploading the following:
